**Course Description**

_Ethical Challenges in Technology_ is a high-level overview of ethical issues within the technology industry. Specific course topics will include current event analysis and case studies of landmark events in the history of computing. Students will analyze particular products and policies that have fundamentally impacted the course of the industry. The course will be primarily discussion-based, with a semester-long project and weekly reflection posts. Students will find that many of the course topics are relevant to other UVA computer science curriculum classes. This structure will allow students to combine existing knowledge with a broad perspective on how these technologies affect the larger industry. 

**Course Logistics**



*   There are 12 weeks of planned course material. 
*   The course will meet Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 2:00-2:50 pm.  
*   Class meetings will be online and synchronous via Zoom on UVA Collab. 
*   In-class discussions and office hours will utilize a class Discord server.
*   This is a discussion-based course, and attendance is required.

    Note: Students will not be penalized for any unavoidable absence but should notify course staff and discussion group members ahead of time, if possible. 


**Learning Goals**

By the end of the course, students should:



*   understand and articulate critical perspectives of computing technologies
*   recognize the importance of ethical considerations in software development
*   assess the social implications of their specific career goals
*   respect diverse opinions and engage in difficult conversations
*   evaluate the ethical responsibilities of individuals and organizations

**Prerequisites**



*   While there are no specific pre-requisite courses, fourth-year Computer Science majors will be prioritized for registration. One week after enrollment registration begins, the course will open to all students. 
*   Come to class with an open mind! Students should be prepared to engage in difficult and sensitive topics of discussion while maintaining respect for other students’ perspectives and ideas. 

**Communications	**



*   _Collab _will be used for:
    *   lectures held on the Online Meetings page
    *   project materials submitted to the Assignments page
    *   assignment grades released to the Gradebook page
*   _Discord _will be used for:
    *   all students are expected to join the class server!
    *   informal lecture chats on topic-specific channels
    *   private discussion group chats
    *   office hours in private voice rooms

    *   important course-wide emails
    *   personal administrative inquiries
    *   notice of unavoidable absences

**Coursework**

_Project_

Throughout the semester, students will engage in a self-guided project consisting of three major parts: project proposal, written deliverable, and presentation. Students will have the chance to work alone or with one additional person on the project. There will be a discussion page for students to share their project ideas and find a partner.

_Discussion Forum_

Every week students will post in an online discussion forum to reflect on the week’s topic or case study. Discussion forum posts are due _before _class. No late submissions will be accepted, but students will be able to participate in a make-up discussion at the end of the semester. 


    _Pre-Discussion_ _(must be posted before Monday class)_


    Students should reflect generally on the assigned readings for Monday’s class and their general expectations regarding the topic. Additional topic-specific reflection questions will be posted on the discussion page.



*   Are there any specific aspects of the issue that you would like to further explore? 
*   Can you identify any perspectives that are missing from the sources?
*   What types of additional sources would help to clarify this issue?
*   What surprised you the most about the initial readings?
*   Has this issue impacted your personal experience in computing?

    _Post-Discussion (must be posted before Friday class)_


    Students should reflect on how their perspective on the topic has changed based on the case studies and discussion groups. Additional topic-specific questions will be posted on the discussion page.

*   How has your perspective changed since the pre-reading?
*   Did any specific discussion in your breakout groups have a significant impact on your understanding of this issue?
*   Going forward, do you expect this issue to impact your personal experience?
*   What surprised you the most about this topic?

**Participation and Professionalism**

In order to help facilitate discussions, breakout sessions will be conducted at various times throughout the course. Students will rotate through four different randomly assigned discussion groups. The size of discussion groups will depend on overall course enrollment but you can expect 4 - 6 students per group. Each discussion group will meet for a three-week period, after which the students will reflect on their experiences and evaluate their fellow group members. The participation and professionalism grade will be based on group evaluations, attendance, and overall engagement. For unavoidable absences, students should notify their discussion group by email and cc the course instructor for visibility. Students are expected to respect the opinions of others and abide by pre-established group norms. 

**Current Event Talks**

Each student will be expected to sign-up for a five-minute lightning talk on a current event. Throughout the semester, students will present the talks at the end of class on Friday. Specific materials are not required, but the talks are expected to be engaging and informative. For full credit, students will be required to post a brief summary of their talk (with links to sources) on the discussion page. There is no specific length requirement, but a sufficient summarization is expected to be around 500 words. Current events are expected to be relevant to any of the themes covered in the course and should be taken from a primary source published during the week of the talk. 

**Self-Care**

Online school can be very challenging for students (and course staff) and we recognize that the lack of face-to-face interaction can have various negative impacts. Throughout the semester, students will be encouraged to spend some time on wellness. Students will reflect on their progress during a bi-weekly judgment-free survey. There will be a chance to give anonymous feedback to course staff and request additional support if needed. 

**Grading**



*   Project (30%)
    *   Project Proposal (5%)
    *   Written Deliverable (15%)
    *   Presentation (10%)
*   Discussion Forum (30%)
*   Participation and Professionalism (20%)
*   Current Event Talk (10%)
*   Self-Care (10%)

**Privacy and Anonymity**

We will be using a private Discord server and the GitHub discussion feature throughout the course to facilitate office hours and discussion forums. If a student does not already have one (or both) of these accounts, they will be expected to make one. Both are free and do not require the use of your UVA email account. 

While Discord provides custom channels and the ability to privately chat with other students, it does not allow for threaded conversations and is unsuitable for discussion forums. The GitHub discussion site is publicly visible but will be taken down at the conclusion of the course. Students with privacy concerns are encouraged to make a new GitHub account with a pseudonym that is not connected to any existing online identities. Students who choose to use a pseudonym should notify course staff by email in order to get credit for grading purposes. 

**Academic Integrity**

We trust every student in this course to fully comply with all of the provisions of the University’s Honor Code. By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the Honor System of the University of Virginia, as well as the following policies specific to this course.



*   All graded assignments must be pledged
*   Students are allowed to collaborate with up to one other student on the project
*   Work by another person should be cited properly when necessary

**SDAC Accommodations**

The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website https://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac

**Religious Accommodations**

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by email as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about your request, you can contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework you miss as the result of a religious observance.

**Additional Support**

If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after-hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.
